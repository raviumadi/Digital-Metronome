# Simple Metronome with ESP32

Metronomes come in all shapes and forms. The mechanical ones have a great aesthetic appeal and often vintage looks. However, commercially available metronomes are pricy. There is no reason to spend that much money if you can build one yourself for your music-based projects.

## Components

- ESP32 or equivalent
- Buzzer/Speaker
- Two buttons - BPM up and down
- Pull up resistors
- LED for visual - optional
- Adafruit SSD1306 display module
- Breadboard and wires

## Housing

Build a 3D-printed housing or fit into a makeshift unit as you please. Do share your designs. I have not built anything for this project, as it will be part of other work.
